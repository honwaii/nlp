    "同学们，今天我们的学习了基本的机器学习概念，相比你已经对机器学习的这些方法有一个基本的认识了。值得说明的是，机器学习不仅仅是一系列方法，更重要的是一种思维体系，即：依据以往的、现有的数据，构建某种方法来解决未见过的问题。而且决策树，贝叶斯只是实现这个目标的一个方法，包括之后的神经网络。很有可能有一天，神经网络也会被淘汰，但是重要的是我们要理解机器学习的目标，就是尽可能的自动化解决未知的问题。"

    "In my opinion, ML is more depended on statistical method. We improve ourself by reading books or self experiece etc. It's same as computer.The differece is that computer learn from the history data. Therse is an advantage of using ML in dealing with the unstructure data such as vedio and audio. For now, more and more data which contain much valuable information are produced everyday. But there are some limits for the tranditional programming in how to develop and use these data. For the tranditional programming, it's easy to handle structured data which has obvious features. But for unstructured data, it's difficut to find some apparent features. ML is capable of capturing some potential information from various data. It's provide a easy way for us to extract valuable data.  \n",

    "It is no doubt that there is no a absolutely model which is suitable all scenarios. We have to select a model accoding to the scenario. And then train an available model with provided data. ML application is based on the real world. It can be used to improve our efficiency. But it is also not available for everthing. In some case, tranditional programming maybe more suitable."

    "This descriotion is right. If we knew the evaluation, we also konw what we want to need. If the evalution defined not right, we may get a model which is not we wanted. For example, if a model selected or trained with a high precision and low recall, it may very complex and even  get error result. On the contray, if we trained with hign recall and ignored the prcision, then we may also got a result that is not we wanted. At the same time, it may spend a lot of time to tarin the model becasue we have to iterate many times for the high precision or recall. So we should define the model correctly. Don't achieve unilaterally a high evalution. After all, our target is to get an useable model. On this condition, we may train the model easier."
